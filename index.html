    <h1>Waste Management</h1>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
            <section class="reduce">
                <h2>Reduce</h2>
                <p>
                    The concept of reducing what is produced and what is consumed is essential to the waste hierarchy. The logic behind it is simple to understand
                     – if there is less waste, then there is less to recycle or reuse. The process of reducing begins with an examination of what you are using,
                     and what it is used for.

        <div class="col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12">
            <section class="reuse">
                <h2>Reuse</h2>
                <p>
                    You may have a box of things you keep that are broken or that you don’t have a use for that you hang on to in-case you find another use for them;
                     or you may find bargains on old furniture or go trash picking and get things that you can refinish – in either case you are working towards
                     reusing the item. Learning to reuse items, or re-purpose them for a use different then what they are intended for is essential in waste hierarchy.

                <h2>Recycle</h2>
                <p>
                    The last stage of the waste hierarchy is to recycle.  One of the issues facing communities that want to become more involved with a recycling
                    effort is that while the relying collection and sorting process may be affordable to implement, there still has to be a facility to receive and transform the discarded waste into a raw material.
